        <p class="caption">I love Wikiapedia. It's always my go-to website whenever I'm interested in anything, which is one of the reasons I love it. It has pages for almost everything you can think of with all the information you could think of. </p>

I'm currently rewatching Santa Clarita Diet and I find it really funny. I'm so sad Netflix cancelled it.</p>

        <p class="caption">Whenever I do homework I have to play music to stay interested. My favorite trick to stay motivated is to play theme music for whatever topic I'm reading or working on.
